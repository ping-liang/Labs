The actual files will be installed into various subdirectories; no files will ever be installed directly into the PREFIX directory.If you have special needs, you can also customize the individual subdirectories with the following options. However, if you leave these with their defaults, the installation will be relocatable, meaning you can move the directory after installation. (The man and doc locations are not affected by this.)For relocatable installs, you might want to use configure's --disable-rpath option. Also, you will need to tell the operating system how to find the shared libraries." data-size="large" data-count="none">Tweet</a>
